Jenkins Plugin for Qt Creator
===============

A simple plugin for QtCreator to monitor a jenkins continuous integration server.

The plugin adds a red or green icon depending on the build status and provides a tooltip to show the current build status.

At the moment, commands to initiate a build are not supported but will hopefully make it into a future version.

Supported Platforms
===================

Should work on all platforms supported by QtCreator, however, it has only been tested on Linux and Windows.
